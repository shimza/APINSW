List of ideas for what I'd like to see the NSW Government convert into an API.

1. List of Foster care matching providors
2. Pricing across a number of fields on Hospital costs and which are mostly covered by the different Private Health Care Funds.
3. Wait times in Hospital emergency areas; this would be great to combine with driving times and ambulance wait times.
4. Best courses to get a job out of
5. Work experience available opportunities within an hours drive of my area.
